## Usage

You have to create PayPal REST sandbox credentials and copy/move config/Config.php.sav to config/Config.php. Insert the credentials into config/Config.php as client_id and client_secret for the correct environment.

## Attention

the approval window will not close automatically, because the return_url is missing in the payload/payment_source/experience_context! Close the tab or window manually and go back to the checkout-window.
